Sorting Algorithm Visualization

Using React.js I wanted to apply what I learned in one of my CS classes while trying to learn HTML CSS Javascript and React

This is a project I made inorder to enhance my learning.
It includes 5 different sorting algorithms and the size of the array can be changed as well.
